## Instagrub

This was an individual project creating a full stack app using Express and EJS. I decided to create an app that would be an Instagram for food recipes, you are able to scroll through recipes and add and share your own.

Technologies used in the project were JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, MongoDB, Express.js and EJS.

This app is deployed on [Heroku](https://instagrub-app.herokuapp.com/).

When the app is loaded, you are immediately taken to you login/sign up page. You have to be logged in to view any recipes.

Once logged in you are taken to the homepage of all the recipes. This is the list of every single recipe someone has added. Alternatively you are able to click on the name of the chef below the recipe image to just see recipes made by them.
