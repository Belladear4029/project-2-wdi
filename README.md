## Instagrub

This was an individual project creating a full stack app using Express and EJS. I decided to create an app that would be an Instagram for food recipes, you are able to scroll through recipes and add and share your own.

Technologies used in the project were JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, MongoDB, Express.js and EJS.

This app is deployed on [Heroku](https://instagrub-app.herokuapp.com/).
